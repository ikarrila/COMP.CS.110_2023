 *
 *   This program implements a mystery carpet applying pattern matching.
 * The carpet consists of squares of different colors, which also holds
 * true for the pattern, but the size of the pattern is always 2 x 2, i.e.
 * it has four colored squares. The program searches for pattern
 * occurrences from the carpet.
 *   At first, the program asks for the size of the carpet (width and heigth).
 * The user is also asked for if the carpet (grid) will be filled with
 * randomly drawn colors, or with user-given ones. In the first option,
 * a seed value for the random number generator will be asked next.
 * In the latter option, the user is asked to input as many colors as the
 * there are squares in the carpet, whereupon the user lists the first
 * letters of the colors as one long string.
 *   On each round, the user is asked for a pattern to be searched for
 * (a string consisting of four letters/colors). The program prints, how
 * many occurrences was found and from which coordinates they were found.
 *   The program checks if the user-given colors are among accepted ones.
 * The program terminates when the user gives a quitting command ('q' or 'Q').
